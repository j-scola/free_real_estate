### Data Analytics for Real Estate Program

# Original Game Plan

1. Create flask server that can receive request parameters
2. Build integration to real estate api to obtain data based on request parameters
3. Develop analytics methodology using Pandas library
4. Return results of analysis to webpage
5. Scrape additional data from real estate websites and serve

# What I Ended Up Building

A python program that scrapes motorcycle listings off craigslist and loads them into jupyter notebook for analysis.
